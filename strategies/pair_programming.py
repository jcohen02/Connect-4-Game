# This file is designed to be edited during a pair programming exercise in-class
# Beginning with a naive random algorithm, your goal is to improve the strategy
# There are sugested steps you might want to take. Begin with "STEP 1", then
# proceed to "STEP 2" and so on (follow the step numbers, not the order they appear
# in the code)
# You can chose to take other steps if you like
# game_master.py is set up to play your code against a naive random strategy
# Run game_master.py to test how your code does

def pair(board, player_number):
    # STEP 2: Let's look one move ahead. If there's a move we can take that will make us win we want to take it
    # Loop over the different indices you might chose to consider whether it results in a victory

        # STEP 3: This should be inside the loop
        # Let's see if any of the available columns we might chose will cause us to win
        # First, create a copy of the original board using board_copy = copy.deepcopy(board)
        # We can edit board_copy without altering the original board variable

        # STEP 4: This should be inside the for loop
        # Use the add_token function from run_game to add one of your tokens to the currently selected row
        # Use the check_victory function from victory_check to see if this new board state results in a victory for you
        # If it does, return the index of the currently considered column
    
    # STEP 5: If the loop above doesn't return a value, the strategy will return a random variable
    # The next step you take could be to consider if there are are any columns your opponent could go in to win and go there instead of them
    # Have a go at implenting this yourselves, or take another step you think would be helpful

    return(random.randint(0, 6))

    # STEP 1: currently this algorithm will place a disc in any column, regardless of it's full or not
    # Modify this function so it will only return a value relating to a non-full column
